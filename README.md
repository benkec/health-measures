Effects of public health measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health

While these previous findings from cross-sectional studies
revealed a negative impact of public health measures on immediate mental health consequences, the long-term
consequences and relevant factors that influence the psychological response to public health measures in the long run need to be characterized to adequately inform the public health care system and policymakers to mitigate longterm adverse mental health effects.
Using the data provided by ZPID (level of restriction due to public health measures in each German federal state on a day-by-day basis) and the repeated cross-sectional SOEP-CoV data, we aim to examine whether mental
health varied depending on the level of restrictions due to public health measures at different time points. Also, we will investigate whether a longer duration or a higher level of restriction (overall level of restriction and level of restriction due to specific measures, e.g. stay-a-t-home orders) will be associated with mental health consequences in the long-run. Moreover, we will investigate whether the association between public health measures and mental health varied by sociodemographic and personality factors.

In our analyses, we will include the following predictors, moderators and outcomes:
Outcome
Life satisfaction (SOEP-Corona, item 68)
Affect (SOEP-Corona, item 55)
Depressive symptoms (SOEP- Corona, item 58)
Anxiety symptoms (SOEP- Corona, item 58)
Loneliness (SOEP- Corona, item 56)
Predictors (provided by ZPID)
- overall restriction due to public health measures
- duration of restriction due to public health measures
- restriction due to specific measures (e.g., stay-at-home orders)
Moderators: sociodemographic factors (age, gender, living alone, living with underage children, educational
level, employment) and personality factors (Big Five, SOEP-Core, 2017)
